# Twitter Sentiment Analysis 

**The aim of our project is to explore and analyze hate speeches on Twitter. At this stage, the model is mainly trained focusing on English sentiments about politics and racism. The detection of sarcasm and irony remains challenging.**

We trained the Dataset with **Three Algorithms, Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBClassifier and Decision Tree.** You can check their comparison scores in the streamllit app,Data Visualization menu.
